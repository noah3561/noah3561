### 👋 Hi there, I'm Noah, and it's nice to virtually meet you!

## 🖥️ I'm a hobbyist developer and an IT enthusiast.

- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate more with other developers on projects.
- 🎓 My goal by the end of 2020 is to have a semi firm grasp on Python.
- 🍳 Fun Fact: I love cooking, singing, and mac n cheese.
